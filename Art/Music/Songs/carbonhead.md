This song is interesting within the context of the album as it's the first song that is grounded in the real world in the lyrics and production (with acoustic sounds!!) and in that regard it's notable. Like it has guitars and drums! Wowzers!

Sounds nice, lyrics are good, if I liked its genre more I could consider rating it higher
