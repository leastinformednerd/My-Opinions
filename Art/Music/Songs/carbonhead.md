This song is interesting within the context of the album as it's the first song that is grounded in the real world in the lyrics and production (with acoustic sounds!!) and in that regard it's notable. Like it has guitars and drums! Wowzers!

Sounds nice, lyrics are good, if I liked its genre more I could consider rating it higher

> Errata 2/2/2025 I've bumped this up to an 8 from a 7, I've really been enjoying it recently, and the sound  has been growing on me. My initial concerns about not being a fan of the genre have lessened as I've listened to it more.
> I also had a friend compare it to a yugoslav song [[Moja si]]
