This song has an interesting vibe. It's definitely a song made with Electronic Instruments and heavy use of Digital Sound Processing but it also evokes the feeling of being in an outdoors environment. In particular in the instrumentation both before and after the first two lines sounds like a forest, with what sounds like birds vocalising and a river running. Then the alien sounds of the rest of instrumentation are grounded in a terrestrial context and it then becomes the sound of a dark, unnerving forest. This vibe is carried on throughout the rest song although it gives way more to give focus on the vocals.

I also like the vocals. They sound really good, the lyrics are good, just all around are nice. The way the song sounds around "Expunge all thoughts" is good, and the pause after is good.  

##### Reasons why I don't think it's a 10
- The transition between verses and after verse 2 to the outro feels a little awkward
- I think the vocal effects are taking too far; certainly they feel a little distracting in parts (notably parts where they are not intended to be the main focus - I don't have issues with them on "Until you mirror your walls, you're alone again already")
