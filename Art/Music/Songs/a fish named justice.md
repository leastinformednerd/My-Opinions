Weird song, the parts that aren't torrents of sound give me almost [[GY!BE]] vibes although I can't say I've listened to enough of them to be sure in that analysis. Those parts sound like the kind of thing that I could see being part of an opening shot of a post-apocalyptic eerie audio-visual project. There is however some magical levity in the production and the vibe is positive in spite of that
