I thoroughly enjoyed Pulp Fiction

Certainly I think I would've enjoyed it more if I had:
1. Not been aware of a lot of the things that happen within it. As it stood I knew a fair portion of the events in the movie through pop-culture osmosis (as it deservedly has a place of popularity within). This didn't ruin the movie but I think some things would be nice to have not known in advance.
2. Seen it in a theatre. I saw it at home on the tv with food. I don't think this environment is great for getting the full experience

However I still really liked. The cinematography was absolutely amazing. I liked the plot and the way that plot was shown throughout the run time. In general I like it when the threads come together like that to form a cohesive neat whole
