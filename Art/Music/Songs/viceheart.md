I like the lyrics on this one a lot. Sonicly it's maybe a six or at most some sort of fractional value bounded by six and seven. To be honest I think this song's lyrics would be better off as a poem.

To get the less interesting sound at the way first. I like it; it's a pleasant listen without undercutting the lyrics. Again I'm limited in my descriptive capabilities by my lack of musical understanding. I like the sounds of wind whistling. 

The lyrics are definitely a nine. They are the reason why I'm rating this as an eight despite the sound not being at that point. Just a perfect encapsulation of a lot of my thoughts.

"Tragically real in the meantime" is such a distillation of how it feels to physically exist, especially as you try to "desperately shape" yourself and continue to age.

I am somewhat fascinated by the imagery in the second verse where transition is depicted as becoming a monster. This stands in contrast with a common framing I see (that's present in the next song in the album: [[endorphin heist]]!) where it's depicted as the opposite, seeing yourself pre-transition as a monster and transition being the process by which you become a human. There's something undeniably powerful about the image of seeing yourself become less and less human, for your body to be changing in unnatural and monstrous ways and for that to *still* be preferable to letting your life progress naturally. 

The verses also provide a neat complement to each other. The first verse, establishing the song presents the passage of time as a terrifying, aging force and placing mirrors as the view by which she sees this happen to her as a passive victim (? I'm not entirely sure on this wording. Victim has connotations that I partially like but mostly don't in this context. Receiver is not better though so *shrug*). On the other hand the second verse has time being a positive force, progressing through her transformation, and although her reflection is still not herself it's getting ever closer.
