The DSM-5 or Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders Fifth Edition is both good and useful and also not good in ways that annoy me. I acknowledge its use and I refer to it for thinking about the worth of pursuing formal diagnosis (so it's directly beneficial to me in that way), but god I hate some of the wording

One example I hate the following quote from the section on [[Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder|ADHD]] (in particular diagnostic criteria 2.e):

> Is often “on the go,” acting as if “driven by a motor”

This is meaningless. What does it mean to be "driven by a motor"?  They do go on to explain it afterwards but like why not just use the explanation afterward. Why use this dogshit meaningless sludge beforehand, it provides no value and muddies the waters for no benefit. 

(A similar question appears in the adult self report screener put out by the american ADD association that includes an equally bad version of this question and has no explanation. This is where my hatred of [[Questionnaires|questionnaires]] started I believe)

Similarly I have difficulty in some parts identifying what is a normative requirement of diagnosis and what is expository supporting information used by clinicians to come to a diagnosis which makes it hard for me to figure out in some cases whether it would be worth pursuing a diagnosis (I don't see the value of spending the money / time, unless I'm fairly confident. I'm effectively treating pursuing diagnosis as getting a professional sign off).

At the very least I'm confident that by it's metrics I unambiguously qualify to be diagnosed with "Predominantly inattentive presentation" of [[Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder|ADHD]] but for instance I find it unlikely by the metrics presented that I would be diagnosed with [[Autism Spectrum Disorder|autism]] under the criteria presented. I talk a bit more about that [[The Possibility I Have ASD |here]] since it's outside the scope of this.

However I can't be sure since I find the text somewhat confusing. Of course part of this is on me, and I'm sure that I could clear it up by reading thoroughly and trying to understand it but I don't think it needs to be that way and better quality writing would have improved it.

Overall has value but could provide that value (to me) better with some changes
