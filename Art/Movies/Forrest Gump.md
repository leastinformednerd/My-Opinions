Definitely not for me, I couldn't finish it. I feel [[Second Hand Embarrassment|second hand embarrassment]] very strongly, and in particular find it difficult when someone (character or otherwise) unknowingly makes a faux pas (possibly because I'm not brilliant at that kind of thing either). One of the main conceits of the movie is a character doing that. Certainly I knew what I was in for when he told a black woman that he was named after the founder of Ku Klux Klan, and it really never got better in that way. Definitely not for me. It's not necessarily bad but it does not work for me
