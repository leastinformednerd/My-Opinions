It lives up to it's name, feels cozy and magical

The arcane (word choice? maybe wrong connotations but I don't want to repeat magical) vibe comes through in the sound design with both the crystalline twinkling and the distorted speech-like (and caw-like) sounds.

On the other hand the music sounds like (and this is possibly influenced by it being 22/12 at time of writing) sounds like depictions of "the night before Christmas" somewhere in the northern hemisphere where I can sit in front of a fire and warm myself up. 

I don't have more rigorous analysis than that, it creates a vibe, I like the vibe, overall a good song but nothing grabs me so it earns a 7
