Wow, this song has a lot of sounds. I'm not super surprised that this is the most scrobbled song off [[my twee monsters|the album]] on [[Last.fm]] since it's a relatively normal song in the scheme of the album. It's something I could see someone dancing to, and it's very chorus heavy. It's still obviously somewhat weird lyrically, the whole album is. But I could see getting caught in pure sound and being able to look past that (if I was dancing to it).

I do like the lyrics certainly in the (singular) verse the imagery fucks incredibly hard. Sadly hard to hear and I wish we got more (although I do not if it could neatly be stretched so I'm not clear if it would actually be better *shrug*). Eyes come up a lot which I find somewhat odd. 

Overall I find it enjoyable and good, but I wish the verse was easier to hear. Also doesn't really grab me so it's a definite six.
