This is really good! It sounds great and it has neat lyrics, what more could you want?

From a sonic perspective it's novel (at least to me) while still having a nice and familiar pop element. The percussion is great, the melody's great, the more supporting unusual background sounds are great. The cog-like / clock-like sounds we're left with at the end are neat, and the through-line of similar sounds throughout the song sounds good. I don't really have a developed enough understanding of music to say much more. Just really enjoyed listening to it

Despite, like [[orphan source]], only having one verse, this song has lyrics I really like. Part of that is things I like happening in the choruses but part of it is just that the verse just resonates with me (both more than [[orphan source|orphan source's]] did, and absolutely). "When I fall asleep I hope I wake up truly naked / with my mind on the outside / put me back to sleep" just sounds great in the song and just emotionally speaks to me in ways I really do not know how to express (either in writing) or to myself. Also the introductory lines are great, same thing resonance wise (although I get why more)
