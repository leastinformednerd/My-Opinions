I like this overall, it has a good thematic through-line and [[viceheart]] and [[endorphin heist]] are stand outs. The sound lends itself well to the theme while standing on its own. There are a few songs on here that aren't for me but tbh I am riding the hype of my favourite songs to rate this as a nine, given the fact there are multiple nines I think it's fair to point to this as an archetype-defining album. I believe I will view other albums through the lens this album provides going into the future.

It makes me sad that tracey brakes' [said her next album will be less up it's own ass](https://x.com/traceybrakes/status/1870040542576554130) since I liked that about this album
