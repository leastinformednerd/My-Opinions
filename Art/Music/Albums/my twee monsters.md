I like this. In particular I am a massive fan of [[endorphin heist]] and since it has monopolised my listening time since I heard it I have less developed opinions on all of them.

Songs in album:
- [[her insides meet gods]]
- [[orphan source]]
- [[back to sleep]]
- [[viceheart]]
- [[endorphin heist]]
- [[fireside thaumaturgy]]
- [[a fish named justice]]
- [[behave, hollow automaton]]
- [[carbonhead]]
