[[This Obsidian Vault|This]] is a forever incomplete list of my opinions of as many things as I can that I'm aware of. It is especially incomplete now in that I started it very recently. It is an obsidian vault, so it should be readable even without exactly the same markdown dialect or as plain text

##### Rating Scheme
Attached to everything I have a written opinion of I have also attached a rating (as an obsidian property, accessible in raw markdown in the yaml at the beginning of the file)

In general I think of my average rating as about 6 (I have a mildly positive opinion on most things, where 5 is neutral). With that in mind the (non-linear) ratings roughly come out to:
1: Really Really Hate
2: Hate
3: Dislike
4: Mildly Dislike
5: Neutral
6: Mildly positive
7: Positive
8: Great!
9: Amazing, archetype defining
10: Perfect in every way (I do not know if such a thing exists, but it's technically categorisable if I become religious or have another form of epiphany)
