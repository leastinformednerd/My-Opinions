Man I hate this so much I feel it very strongly and I hate it more than first hand embarrassment (possibly in some ways because if I do something I am less likely to notice it, because if I knew it was embarrassing I wouldn't have done it, but other people I can recognise doing it). This legitimately reduces my ability to see a vast swath of [[Movies|movies]] (and some other [[Art|art]]) since a common comedic conceit is characters doing embarrassing things and not realise it (which I often find worse than when a character does realise it, because it resolves it cathartically instead of letting it hang over everything).
