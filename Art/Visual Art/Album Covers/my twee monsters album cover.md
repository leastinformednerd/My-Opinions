I like the character (tracey?) on the album cover. It looks good, fits the album well and elevates the imagery in certain songs ([[viceheart]] and [[orphan source]] stand out to me in this regard). I also like the contour lines / topographic map in the background it elevates it beyond just a red square while not being distracting
