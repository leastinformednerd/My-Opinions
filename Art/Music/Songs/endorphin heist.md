THE song off of the album (imo, although I guess that's a given in this context). The production is the idealised form sung hyperpop and it sounds great, and lends itself perfectly to accentuate the lyrics while still standing on its own when it need to.

The first thing you hear when you listen to it is the lines "Tomorrow when I wake up / I hope I'm either under six feet or six feet under".  This simultaneously sounds great and beats you over the head unsubtly with the meaning.

The recurring lyrical motif of "TV taught me to scream whenever I see a monster / Glimpses in the mirror's where this usually fosters" is not any more discreet. Somewhat interestingly it appears to reverse the monster metaphor being used in [[viceheart]] and keeping in line with that it has a much more bleak outlook. There's really no textual support for things ever getting better.
